## Important Code for Today

### useEffect for Auth State Management
```js
useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, currentUser => {
        setUser(currentUser);
        if (currentUser) {
            // Get token and store on client
            const userInfo = { email: currentUser.email };
            axiosPublic.post('/jwt', userInfo)
                .then(res => {
                    if (res.data.token) {
                        localStorage.setItem('access-token', res.data.token);
                    }
                });
        } else {
            // Remove token if user is logged out
            localStorage.removeItem('access-token');
        }
        setLoading(false);
    });
    return () => {
        return unsubscribe();
    };
}, [axiosPublic]);
